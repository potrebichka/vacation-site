        <p>Toyko is by far the cleanest city to which I have ever travelled. It is aso the largest and busiest city to which I have ever travelled. The amount of effort the people of Tokyo go to in order to ensure both sanity and sanitation is simply astounding.

        <p>I enjoy exploring Tokyo for it's innovative technology, it's delicious high quality cuisine and the shopping. I loved visiting the electronics district (Akihabara), especially Yodobashi electronics store to see what are the latest gadgets, visiting the trendy district (Shibuya) for it's stylish clothes and anime. Toys are everywhere. Japanese anime is everywhere. My favorite stores to visit for that are Kiddy Land & Snoopy Town in Harajuku. So much to see, so little time to see everything. Try to stay at least one week in Tokyo before visiting other cities in Japan. You'll need at least that amount of time to see a good portion of Tokyo.</p>

        <p>Even though it's very far from Europe or US, really worth every single second being there !!!
        Everything's in order and you see only polite people that are willing to help and find a solution to a visitor problem, no matter if they know english or not !!!

        We've enjoyed it very much !!! We stayed at Shinjuku area, near central station and look forward to go there again some time !!!
